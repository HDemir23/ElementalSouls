# ReviewOne — Project Review

Date: 2025-10-04

Executive Summary:
The repo implements Elemental Souls: smart contract + backend Fastify + Next.js frontend.
Overall code is organized, key flows implemented: EIP-712 permits, AI generation, IPFS upload, task system.
The frontend contains scaffolded UI but lacks API client and full integration.

Scope of review:
- Read Solidity contract: ElementalSouls (ElementalSouls/src/ElementalSouls.sol)
- Backend services and routes: Backend/src/...
- Frontend components and libs: Frontend/...
- Spec: ELEMENTAL_SOULS_SPEC.txt

High-level findings
1) Smart contract
- ElementalSouls implements EIP-712 evolve permits with nonce+deadline — matches spec.
- Soulbound pattern enforced by reverting transfers.
- tokenURI, nonce, level storage present; events emitted for evolution and milestones.
- Suggest verifying edge cases: tokenId counter overflow, _tokenIdCounter initial value, and access-control boundaries.

2) Backend
- Fastify routes implement core endpoints: /evolution/*, /tasks/*, /mint/*, /nft/*.
- SignerService uses viem wallet client to sign EIP-712 permits server-side; IPFS service uses nft.storage.
- AIImageService integrates Replicate; metadata generation and IPFS upload flows exist.
- Database schema includes task_completions, evolution_history, pending_signatures — good alignment.
- Error handling is present but could benefit from structured HTTP error codes and machine-readable error codes.

3) Frontend
- Next.js app has UI components and wagmi wiring; many components are placeholders or call contracts directly.
- No centralized API client under Frontend/lib/apiClient.ts — missing integration to backend endpoints.
- Contract ABI and address are present under Frontend/lib/contracts/elementalSouls.ts.
- Viem client helper exists; wallet provider is scaffolded.

4) Integration points & gaps
- Evolution flow: Backend creates permit & signature; frontend currently expects to call backend then call contract.evolve(). UI scaffolding exists but missing API calls and polling for job status.
- Tasks: Endpoints exist; frontend lacks useTasks hook to call /tasks/available, /tasks/submit, /tasks/progress.
- IPFS: Backend uploads to NFT.Storage server-side; frontend should render preview using ipfsService.toGatewayURL converted URIs.
- Real-time updates: Backend exposes job IDs and evolution/status endpoints in spec but no SSE or websocket implementation found in code. Polling endpoint /evolution/status/:jobId exists in spec but implementation may be synchronous; recommend explicit jobId/status or SSE.

Security & Operations
- Env validation strong in Backend/src/config/env.ts using zod — ensures required secrets presence.
- Sensitive keys: SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY, NFT_STORAGE_API_KEY — must use secrets manager in production; README notes this.
- Rate limiting rules exist in spec and routes mention TODO for admin auth on verify endpoints.
- SIWE + JWT authentication middleware present — ensure frontend uses tokens for API calls.

Risks and Bugs Found
- AIImageService.generateSeed uses Date.now() causing nondeterministic seeds — conflicts with "deterministic" claim in spec.
- Some functions may throw generic errors — consider consistent error shapes { code, message, details }.
- Backend ipfs.service uses NFT.Storage storeBlob on arbitrary blobs — be mindful of size/timeouts when uploading large images.
- Evolution job flow: evolution.routes.request currently does synchronous AI generation and IPFS upload — this can block and hit rate limits; moving to asynchronous job queue (BullMQ) recommended (spec mentions queue).

Recommendations (priority order)
1. Create Frontend API client: Frontend/lib/apiClient.ts with:
   - baseUrl from NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
   - typed methods: checkEligibility, requestEvolution, getEvolutionStatus, confirmEvolution, getTasksAvailable, submitTask, getTaskProgress
   - retry logic with exponential backoff for 429/5xx and network errors
2. Implement useEvolution and useTasks hooks that call the client and integrate with React Query for caching and retries.
3. Change backend evolution request to enqueue AI job and return jobId immediately; expose GET /evolution/status/:jobId or SSE for updates. If not possible now, ensure frontend polls /evolution/request response appropriately.
4. Replace deterministic seed generation to not include Date.now(), use tokenId+level+constant to guarantee reproducibility if desired.
5. Standardize API error shapes and document them in README / API.md.
6. Ensure frontend consumes IPFS gateway URLs (use ipfsService.toGatewayURL equivalent) — Frontend should display preview.imageUrl provided by backend.
7. Add environment example file Frontend/.env.example containing NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC.

Implementation notes for frontend devs
- Do not attempt to sign permits client-side; backend SignerService handles signatures. Frontend must call /evolution/request and receive permit + signature and then call contract.evolve(permit, signature) via wagmi/viem.
- After sending evolve transaction, call POST /evolution/confirm { tokenId, txHash } to let backend record and mark pending_signature used.
- For task submission with proofs (images), upload to a trusted image host (or send base64) and include URL in proof.url.

Testing suggestions
- End-to-end test: seed DB tasks, create user via SIWE, complete required tasks, call /evolution/request and simulate contract.evolve() with returned signature on a local Anvil chain.
- Unit tests for SignerService.verifySignature and ipfsService.uploadCompleteNFT.

Documentation gaps
- Frontend README notes but lacks example NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL; add explicit examples and how to run frontend against local backend (e.g., export NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000).
- API documentation (Swagger) is configured in backend; link to it in Frontend README.

Next steps (suggested)
- I can implement Frontend/lib/apiClient.ts and hooks: useTasks/useEvolution, add Frontend/.env.example, and wire NFTUpgradeCard/EvolutionPreview to use them. (Will not change existing code per your request — will add new files).
- Or I can produce a PR checklist and code snippets for frontend integrators to implement the client and hooks.

Conclusion
The project is well-structured with most core flows implemented server-side. The main missing piece is frontend↔backend integration: a typed API client, task/evolution hooks, and real-time job status handling. Addressing the recommended items will enable full end-to-end evolution flow without changing smart contract logic.
